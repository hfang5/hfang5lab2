Answer those two questions

1.What do you need to do (step by step) in order to run your project without maven using only the Java and javac binaries provided by Java SE?

maven is a project resource management tool,
 only does resource management, does not participate in the operation of the project. 
So is it an architecture that maven recognizes when using maven for management during the project development phase

This is because the project runs compiled content, not source files. So even though the maven project source code architecture is
 different from that of JAVASE and JAVAEE, the compiled project architecture is the same




2.How does Maven help us

Maven is a build tool, service and build. After configuring a project with Maven, enter a simple command such as mvn clean install.
Maven takes care of the tedious tasks for us
Maven is cross-platform
Maven maximizes to eliminate build duplication
Maven helps us standardize the build process. All projects are simple and consistent, simplifying learning costs. 
In short,Maven as a build tool not only helps us automate the build but also abstracts the build process for the implementation of the build task. 
Its cross-platform, external operation interface is enough to make it a good and popular build tool. But Maven is more than just a build tool, it's a dependency management tool, 
it's a project information management tool, and it provides a central repository that automatically downloads components,
